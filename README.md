# Manifold learning with Feature-type distributed clustering workflow is more informative compared to UMAP for tabular clinical datasets
* We experimented on clinical and bio-medical datasets to prove that Feature-types Distributed Clustering (FDC) gives more interpretable clusters than conventional UMAP.
* FDC_intermediate_Dimension: this folder contains all necessary libraries(FDC), python code(Jupyter notebooks), and their respective datasets(CSV files) used to extract clusters from FDC intermediate dimension.
* FDC_low_Dimension: this folder contains all necessary libraries(FDC),  python code(Jupyter notebooks), and their respective datasets(CSV files) used to extract clusters from FDC low dimensions.
* To run any notebook, please ensure that library FDC, cluster.py, and its respective data(.CSV) are on the same path.
